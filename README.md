## üó£Ô∏è Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

**Minitalk** is a project where the goal is to implement a simple data exchange program using UNIX signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`). The program consists of a server and a client, where the client sends a message to the server, and the server decodes and prints it.

The objective of this project is to deepen the understanding of inter-process communication (IPC) using signals, while also ensuring that the communication is efficient and error-free.

## üß¨ Project Structure <a id="structure"></a>

This project consists of two main parts: the **client** and the **server**.

- **Server**: The server is responsible for receiving messages from the client. It decodes the signals sent by the client and displays the message in real-time. The server can handle multiple clients sequentially.
  
- **Client**: The client takes two parameters, the `server's PID` and the `message` to be sent. It encodes the message as a series of signals and sends them to the server.

Communication between the client and the server is done using only two UNIX signals: `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.

## ü´• Cloning the Repository <a id="cloning"></a>

To clone this repository and compile the project, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pin3dev/42_Minitalk.git
cd 42_Minitalk/minitalk
```
This will download the project to your local machine. Once inside the `minitalk` directory, run the provided `Makefile` to compile the project.

## üïπÔ∏è Compilation and Usage <a id="usage"></a>

### Makefile

The project comes with a `Makefile` to automate the compilation process. The Makefile includes the following rules:

- `all`: Compiles the server and client programs.
- `clean`: Removes object files.
- `fclean`: Removes object files and the executables.
- `re`: Recompiles the entire project.

To compile the project, run:
```bash
make
```
This will generate the executables `server` and `client`.

### Basic Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   ./server
   ```
   The server will display its `PID`. This is required for the client to communicate with the server.

2. Send a message from the client:
   ```bash
   ./client <server-pid> "Your message here"
   ```
   The client will send the message to the server, which will then print it.

3. The server can handle multiple clients without needing to restart.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Norms and Guidelines Disclaimer <a id="norms"></a>

This project follows the [**42 School Norm**](https://github.com/pin3dev/42_Cursus/blob/b9cd0fe844ddb441d0b3efb98abcee92aee49535/assets/General/norme.en.pdf) guidelines. Certain decisions in the implementation may seem unconventional, but they were necessary to comply with the strict coding standards enforced by the school.

## üìñ Theoretical Background <a id="theoretical"></a>
